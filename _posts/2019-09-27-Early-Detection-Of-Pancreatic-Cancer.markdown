## Introduction & Background

**Pancreatic Cancer** is one of the most life-threatening cancers in the world. It takes away lives of around 300,000 people worldwide. Currently, thereâ€™s an urgent need for the early detection of this disease to increase the survival rates of this deadly cancer.   
Generally, it is diagnosed using:
- Scans like PET, CT or MRI.  
- Biopsy or,
- CA19-9 Blood Test

But according to **American College of Radiology**, no imaging exams should be done unless there is a clear medical benefit, also these scans are too expensive, which is not viable for a normal person to regularly take these scans. 
**Biopsies** on the other hand, often lead to confirmatory diagnosis, but a doctor usually recommends a biopsy after the patient has presented with almost all signs for a tumor. As it is an _Invasive procedure_, a patient can't take biopsy tests for general screening. 
Coming to the **CA19-9 blood test**, it has a poor specificity & sensitivity of just **_65-70%_**, hence cannot be used as a screening tool for the general population. 

## Proposed Solution

### Spermine as a potential Bio-marker

According to a recent study, it was found that an increase of poly-amine concentration in bio-fluids correlates with increased cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. In Carcinomas like that of the pancreas, significant  up-regulation of the 4 different poly-amines were found to have significant changes in salivary concentrations of Pancreatic Cancer vs Non-pancreatic Cancer patients 
- Spermine
- N1 Acetylspermine
- N1 Acetylspermidine
- 2-amino-butanoate 

Hence, Spermine was endorsed as a marker for Pancreatic Cancer.

### Lateral Flow Assay for Analyzing the concentration of Spermine

![Lateral_Flow_Assay](https://groeptms1316.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/assay-config.jpg)

We have designed a novel strip based assay to analyze the concentration of **Spermine Protein**  through saliva. By the presence of 40nm carboxyl gold, a conjugate, it shows a color change at the _control line_, when target spermine present in the saliva binds with **_Anti-spermine gold-conjugated antibody_** & is detected by the **_Secondary detector probe_**.  

After the test has been conducted, the intensity of the color change would be measured through a Convolution Neural Network based web application which would effectively confirm either the test showed positive or negative results & if positive then classify in which stage is the tumor most likely to be. 

### Novelty
* This is the _first ever_ strip to detect Pancreatic Cancer through saliva and it is nearly **125 times cheaper** than general _CT/MRI/PET scans_ & **10 times cheaper** than the _CA19-9 ELISA Blood test_.
* All the previous methods requires Serum as a bio-fluid which is obtained through a _minimally invasive procedure_ but our procedure requires _Saliva_ as the bio-fluid which is totally non-invasive. (can be performed at home as well). 
* We have integrated a smart web application based reader which easily distinguishes between _normals & Pancreatic Cancer patients_ and makes the process even more _Point of Care_.
