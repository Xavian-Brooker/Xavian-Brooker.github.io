Recently me **(a.k.a Harsh**) and my project partner **Anmol** were awarded the [Pradhan Mantri Bal Shakti Puraskar 2020](http://nca-wcd.nic.in/) in the field of innovation for our project on **_â€˜Early Detection of Pancreatic Cancerâ€™_**

This year it was conferred to **49 children** between the age group of 5-18 years under various categories including bravery, social service, sports, art and culture, innovation and scholastic. A cash award of 1 Lakh, a tablet, and a medal was presented to each awardee. Â 

It was a six-day event from **21st January to 26th January 2020**. It was a hell-of-a-blast! And I know I'm nearly 10 days late for writing this blog but its not my fault (actually, it is) - high resolution weren't uploaded yet! (What a lame excuse Harsh...). Anyways, I finally decided to pour out my heart (**_metaphorically!_**). So here it begins!

## Day One: 'Where it all began' - 21st January 2020 ##

We all gathered at the Hotel Ashok, the place of stay, on 21st. The hotel was awesome but more flabbergasting was the vibe as I would be spending a week with 49 amazing people. We checked in, rested for somewhile and then reported for briefing and collecting our tailored blazers (It looked awesome on meðŸ˜Ž). Anyways, in the night, I met some awesome people - 

(_p.s - I'm going to nickname them so that I don't forget. JUST BARE WITH MEðŸ˜…_)
I met `The Soccer Dude (a.k.a Arjun Pandey)`, `The Einstien Visa Girl (a.k.a Harshita Arora)`: A super-awesome dude('ess) working in the Silicon Valley!, `The Haryanvi Dude (a.k.a Paritosh Dahiya)`: We had already met at IRIS 2017, `The Planet Dude (a.k.a Richard Joseph)` A super-awesome guy (More stuff coming about him soon!) & `Arunima Sen (No Nicknames required for her)`: Funny story though - I 

## Day Two: 'The Day has finally Arrived - 22nd January 2020'

It was Day 2 and this was the day when we would be getting the **'AWARD'** from the President of India at The Rashtrapati Bhavan. Me, My Mom & Dad and everyone got ready early in the morning becuase of the excitement. We were first given a tour of the Rashtrapati Bhavan and then we were introduced to everyone else and with the Awardees of last year. Every awardee was allowed along with 2 escorts to the Darbar Hall where the medal was awarded by the Honorable President of India. In the evening, all the awardees were gathered for the briefing for the dress rehearsal to be scheduled on 23rd January.

On 23rd, we were taken to the Rajpath for the Republic Day parade rehearsals. In the afternoon and the extended evening, We were called up to meet and interact with the Minister of Women & Child Development â€“ Smiti Irani â€“ followed by a press conference where all the awardees were asked to share our success stories and the difficulties We faced in our journey.

24th was a rather prestigious day as we were presented with the opportunity to meet with Honorable Prime Minister â€“ Shri Narendra Modi. All the awardees were fortunate enough to obtain a personal photograph along with a combined group picture. Then, our Prime Minister had an interactive session with us that followed up to the lunch. In the evening we were to be summoned for the Doordashanâ€™s interview followed by Rajya Sabha TVâ€™s interview.

On 25th, all awardees were taken out for Delhi Darshan; in the evening, we were called for Republic Dayâ€™s parade instructions. On the 26th of January, Republic Day, we all were summoned on open jeeps at the Rajpath early morning. We were presented with the prestigious opportunity to be a part of the parade till the India Gate. After the parade, all the awardees along with the escorts were called for the closing ceremony. The ceremony was lit up by the gracious words of few intellectual dignatories and filled with joy by the tremendous performances by some of the awardees. The event ended on 26th with a final group photograph along with a dispersal goodbye and best wishes for the future!Â
